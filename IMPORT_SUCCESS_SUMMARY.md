- [ ] VIP award winners (2025 suppliers with awards)
- [ ] Past suppliers not in 2026
- [ ] Past non-supplier judges
- [ ] Loyal multi-year judges

### Phase 5: 2024 Supplier Data (When Available)
- [ ] Add 2024 supplier email addresses
- [ ] Import 2024 supplier participation data
- [ ] Cross-reference with 2024 judges
- [ ] Complete award winner tracking

## How to Query the Data

### View all participations for a specific person:
```sql
-- Judge participations
SELECT * FROM judge_participations
WHERE email = 'example@email.com'
ORDER BY year;

-- Supplier participations
SELECT * FROM supplier_participations
WHERE email = 'example@email.com'
ORDER BY year;
```

### Count participations by year:
```sql
-- Judges by year and type
SELECT year, judge_type, COUNT(*)
FROM judge_participations
GROUP BY year, judge_type
ORDER BY year, judge_type;

-- Suppliers by year
SELECT year, COUNT(*), SUM(sauce_count) as total_sauces
FROM supplier_participations
GROUP BY year;
```

### Find award winners:
```sql
SELECT email, company_name, sauce_count
FROM supplier_participations
WHERE has_awards = true AND year = 2025;
```

### Find supplier-judges:
```sql
SELECT
  jp.email,
  jp.full_name,
  jp.year,
  sp.company_name,
  sp.has_awards
FROM judge_participations jp
JOIN supplier_participations sp
  ON jp.email = sp.email AND jp.year = sp.year
WHERE jp.judge_type = 'supplier';
```

### Find judges who participated multiple years:
```sql
SELECT email, full_name, COUNT(DISTINCT year) as years_count
FROM judge_participations
GROUP BY email, full_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT year) >= 2
ORDER BY years_count DESC;
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Database
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20251106000102_create_participation_tracking.sql`

### Scripts
- ✅ `eu-hot-sauce-awards/scripts/import-historical-data.ts`
- ✅ `eu-hot-sauce-awards/scripts/import-historical-data-README.md`
- ✅ `eu-hot-sauce-awards/package.json` (added fuse.js)

### Documentation
- ✅ `HISTORICAL_DATA_IMPORT_TODO.md` - Detailed checklist
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete overview
- ✅ `QUICKSTART_IMPORT.md` - Step-by-step guide
- ✅ `IMPORT_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Troubleshooting Reference

If you need to re-run the import:
```bash
# From EUHA root
export PROJECT_URL="your-url"
export SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-key"
npx tsx eu-hot-sauce-awards/scripts/import-historical-data.ts
```

The script uses `UPSERT` with `(email, year)` unique constraint, so it's safe to run multiple times - it will update existing records rather than creating duplicates.
