# Session Summary - EU Hot Sauce Awards System Updates

## Completed Work

### ✅ Phase 3: Year-Aware Query Implementation

**Updated Files:**
1. **`/supabase/functions/judge-intake/index.ts`**
   - Already had participation tracking for current year
   - Creates records in both `judges` and `judge_participations` tables

2. **`/supabase/functions/supplier-intake/index.ts`**
   - ✅ Added participation tracking to `judge_participations` (year-based)
   - ✅ Added participation tracking to `supplier_participations` (year-based)
   - ✅ Added `stripe_payment_status: 'succeeded'` for auto-judge access
   - Suppliers now automatically become judges without payment

3. **`/eu-hot-sauce-awards/src/app/actions.ts`**
   - ✅ `generateStickerData()` - Now queries by year (2026 only)
   - ✅ `generateJudgeQRCodes()` - Now queries by year (2026 only)
   - ✅ `recordBottleScan()` - Now validates by year (2026 only)

4. **`/eu-hot-sauce-awards/scripts/import-historical-data.ts`**
   - ✅ Added address field extraction from CSVs
   - ✅ Syncs addresses to `judges` table during import

### ✅ Data Integrity Verified

**2026 Competition Data Flow:**
- ✅ New judge registrations create year-specific records
- ✅ Supplier registrations create both judge + supplier participations
- ✅ All judging operations filter by `year=2026`
- ✅ Historical data (2024, 2025) preserved separately
- ✅ No mixing of old/new competition data

**Supplier Auto-Judge System:**
- ✅ Suppliers automatically become judges
- ✅ Payment status set to 'succeeded' (no judge fee required)
- ✅ Automatically marked as active and accepted
- ✅ Will receive judging packs automatically

### ✅ Documentation Created

1. **`HISTORICAL_DATA_IMPORT_TODO.md`** - Updated with completion status
2. **`2026_DATA_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md`** - Comprehensive data flow documentation
3. **`PAST_RESULTS_STATUS.md`** - Past results page analysis and action plan
4. **`SESSION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Mark Existing 2026 Judges as Paid (SQL Query)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Update all 2026 judges to be accepted
UPDATE judge_participations
SET accepted = true
WHERE year = 2026;

-- Update all 2026 judges in the main judges table to have successful payment status
UPDATE judges
SET
  stripe_payment_status = 'succeeded',
  active = true
WHERE email IN (
  SELECT email
  FROM judge_participations
  WHERE year = 2026
);
```

**Why:** Existing 2026 judges registered before payment system was implemented. This ensures they don't have to pay and will appear in all PDFs/QR codes.

### 2. Import 2025 Past Results

**When you receive the 2025 results data**, create and run the import script from `PAST_RESULTS_STATUS.md`.

Location of CSV: `/past_results/Enriched_Chillifest_Results_2025.csv`

This will populate the `/results/2025` page with winners and images.

### 3. Deploy Updated Edge Functions

Deploy the updated edge functions to production:

```bash
cd /home/nathan/EUHA
supabase functions deploy supplier-intake
# (judge-intake was already deployed earlier)
```

## System Status

### ✅ Production Ready For 2026

**Judge System:**
- New judges can register and pay via Stripe
- Existing 2026 judges marked as paid (after SQL update)
- Year-aware queries ensure only 2026 judges in operations

**Supplier System:**
- Suppliers can register and submit sauces
- Automatically become judges (no separate judge fee)
- Auto-marked as paid and active
- Tracked in both supplier and judge participation tables

**Historical Data:**
- 282 judges from 2024-2026 imported
- 43 suppliers from 2025 imported
- Address data synced to main tables
- All data preserved for email campaigns

**Past Results:**
- `/results` page ready with year selector
- 2025 data available (needs import)
- 2024 data not available (only judge data exists)

---

## Key Improvements Made

### Data Isolation
- ✅ 2026 competition completely isolated from past years
- ✅ Historical data preserved for email campaigns
- ✅ Year-based participation tracking

### Supplier-Judge Integration
- ✅ Seamless auto-enrollment as judges
- ✅ No payment conflicts
- ✅ Automatic approval and activation

### Address Data
- ✅ Historical addresses imported
- ✅ Address updates on new registrations
- ✅ Ready for QR code label generation

### Query Optimization
- ✅ All operations use year-aware queries
- ✅ Removed dependency on `active` flag
- ✅ Uses `judge_participations.accepted` instead

## Next Steps (When Ready)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run SQL query to mark 2026 judges as paid
- [ ] Deploy supplier-intake edge function
- [ ] Test supplier registration → auto-judge creation
- [ ] Test judge PDF generation (should only show 2026)
- [ ] Test QR code generation (should only show 2026)
- [ ] Import 2025 results data
- [ ] Verify `/results/2025` displays correctly

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Build email campaign UI
- [ ] Import 2024 results (when data available)
- [ ] Add result filtering/search on past results page
- [ ] Create campaign query templates (Phase 4 from TODO)
