It would be an absolute honour to be a judge once again for this new edition of the Chili Fest. I’ve had plenty of experience with hot sauces and chili challenges, including several League of Fire events—whether it was braving Culley’s World’s Hottest Ramen or tackling the “Nougat to Be Kidding Me” challenge. I am not afraid of the heat and the spiciness so bring it on!

Being part of the Chili Fest community has always been a thrill, and I’d be proud to contribute once more as a judge.

Looking forward to the heat
Regards,
Jonathan"

my name is Dirk and I would love to be a judge for the hot sauce awards. In my professional life I am managing a chain of ice cream shops in Berlin called Vanille&amp;amp;Marille. While our ice cream is of course not spicy, tasting, evaluating and improving our recipes and flavors is a big part of my job. 
In my private life I am a huge hot sauce and chili enthusiast. You’ll find me at all the Chili Fests in Berlin spending hundreds of Euros on hot sauces or on my balcony growing my own chilis. This year I also started making my own hot sauces. 
I can handle all spice levels and have no food restrictions. I enjoy all flavors from rather plain to very experimental.
I hope you consider me as a judge, because I think I bring a lot of experience to the table both in the field of hot sauces and also in the field of describing and evaluating food. 

If you need any more information please let me know. It would be an honor to help you judge some hot sauces.

Greetings
Dirk"
"35","09/22/2025","Ben Güthlein","bgueth1@gmail.com","Gabriel-Max-Str. 5","10245","Berlin","Germany","very-keen-amateur-food-chili-person","Hey there! So I'm not a professional chef or anything fancy like that – I'm actually a digital marketer by day. But honestly? Hot sauce has been my absolute obsession for the past eight years, and it's gotten to the point where my friends literally won't go to a restaurant with me unless they're prepared for me to interrogate the server about their hot sauce selection.

I've been cooking since I was a teenager, mostly self-taught with some random YouTube Videos along the way. Nothing formal, but I've gotten pretty decent at it. What really kicked everything into high gear was when I moved to NYC back in 2017 – that city will absolutely ruin you for mediocre hot sauce. I started making my own sauces about five years ago, and I've probably made over 200 different batches at this point. My kitchen looks like a mad scientist's lab with all the fermenting jars and pepper varieties I've got going.
I'm not gonna lie – I've probably tried close to 500 different hot sauces. I keep a notebook (yeah, I'm that guy) where I rate them on heat level, flavor complexity, ingredient balance, and overall vibe. My friends think I'm nuts, but I can usually guess the main peppers in a sauce within the first taste.

This is where I get a little embarrassed to admit how deep I've gone down this rabbit hole. I've been to three hot sauce festivals (including the NYC Hot Sauce Expo twice), and I literally plan vacations around trying regional hot sauce scenes. Last year I drove four hours just to visit this tiny shop in Mexico that makes incredible green chile sauces.
I've also got this weird thing where I can usually tell you the approximate Scoville range of a sauce just by tasting it – comes from years of gradually building up my tolerance and really paying attention to how different heat levels feel. Started with Sriracha like everyone else, now I'm regularly eating stuff in the 100k+ range without breaking a sweat.
The community aspect is what I love most though. There's something special about sharing a really good sauce with someone and watching their face light up when they taste it. I've converted so many people from thinking hot sauce is just about pain to understanding it's actually about flavor enhancement.

- Why I'd Make a Good Judge -

Look, I know I don't have the fancy credentials, but what I do have is genuine passion and a palate that I've trained through years of obsessive tasting. I approach every sauce with curiosity rather than trying to show off how much heat I can handle. I think about balance – how the heat plays with acidity, sweetness, smokiness, whatever other flavors are in there.
I'm also pretty good at explaining what I'm tasting in regular person language instead of super pretentious food critic speak. Like, I'll tell you if something tastes &quot;bright and zingy with a slow burn that builds nicely&quot; rather than going off about &quot;the sauce's terroir&quot; or whatever.
Plus, I think having someone on the panel who represents the serious amateur crowd could be valuable. I buy hot sauce the way normal people buy groceries – I'm always looking for that perfect balance of flavor, heat, and value. I know what works for everyday use versus special occasion sauces.

I get that you probably have applications from people with way more impressive credentials than mine. But I promise you won't find anyone more genuinely excited about hot sauce or more committed to giving thoughtful, honest feedback. This isn't just a hobby for me – it's become a legitimate passion that I take seriously while still having fun with it.
If you pick me, I'll bring enthusiasm, a well-trained palate, and the perspective of someone who represents the core hot sauce community. Plus, I promise not to be one of those judges who's just trying to prove how much heat they can handle – I'm all about finding sauces that actually taste amazing.

Thanks for considering my application. "

My name is Tally, and I am a neuroscientist by profession, and my husband works in IT, but together we are passionate food lovers with a particular enthusiasm for hot sauces. We frequently explore the culinary scene and often find ourselves discovering restaurants just before they receive their first Michelin star.

At home, we cook extensively — often experimenting with a blend of science and creativity in the kitchen. Each year, we grow chili peppers on our balcony and create our own hot sauces, comparing and refining recipes. We also enjoy sampling and critiquing sauces from around the world, paying attention to their flavor complexity, balance of heat, afterburn, and originality.

We would love to bring our analytical perspective and enthusiasm for chili culture to the judging panel. I believe my professional background as a neuroscientist sharpens my sensory observation and descriptive abilities, and our shared passion for food means we can provide thoughtful, detailed, and objective feedback."
